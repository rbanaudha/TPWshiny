# TPWshiny: an interactive R/Shiny app to explore cell line transcriptional responses to anti-cancer drugs
TPWshiny is a robust, independent visualization tool for comprehensive genome-wide profiling of NCI-60 human cancer cell lines' responses to 15 distinct anticancer drugs across multiple time intervals. This data is sourced from the NCI Transcriptional Pharmacodynamics Workbench (NCI TPW), which compiles measured transcriptional responses to anticancer agents. While the NCI TPW data is accessible through a web interface with limited interactivity, TPWshiny, designed as an R Shiny application, enhances data exploration. It offers an intuitive interface that enhances comprehension of tumor cell characteristics across nine different tissue types, aiding researchers in their investigations. The data is presented through interactive scatter plots, heat maps, time series, and Venn diagrams, allowing users to query information based on drug concentration, time points, genes, and tissue types, with the option to download the data for further analysis.
TPWshiny has been deployed on a shinyapp server.
